			<title>31b: Generation Ships</title>
			<description>
        In this special bonus episode, SPEXcast discusses the concept of generation ships. Barring extreme advances in space travel technology and our understanding of physics, it could take hundreds or thousands of years to send humans to other worlds. This would necessite self sustaining societies to exist on these vessels, acting as caretakers for the human race until they arrive at their new home. We discuss the moral implications of sending our successors off into space with no chance of seeing their final destination. </description>

			<title>30: Meta Discussion on Spacecraft Construction and Design</title>

        Science fiction is dominated by gigantic spaceships exploring the stars, however real life spacecraft appear to be made of smaller, discrete pieces. On the other hand, games like Kerbal Space Program present building rockets as simple as snapping together lego pieces. How much is science and how much is fiction?       </description>

			<title>17: Brendan Byrne Interview</title>
			<description>
			Part 2 of the SPEX Summer Series: Phil, Drew, TJ, and Augie sit down with space reporter Brendan Byrne. a producer for public radio station WMFE 90.7 in Orlando, a space reporter for Florida’s Space Coast, and hosts the space exploration podcast Are We There Yet. We dive into the changing political landscape of the Florida Space Coast. What has changed since the shuttle stopped flying in 2011? How are SpaceX and Blue Origin reshaping the space coast to support commercial activities in space? \n
